# Fiort-Softwar

Welcome to this simple Python tool with a user-friendly interface built using the tkinter library. Its purpose? To help you tidy up your cluttered files by sorting them based on their creation date or file types.

## How to Use

1. Start by running the script `fiort_software.py`.
2. You'll see a button labeled "Select Directory". Click it to pick the folder where your messy files are hanging out.
3. Now, choose how you want your files organized. You can sort them by their creation date or their file types. Just select your preference from the dropdown menu.
4. Ready for the magic? Hit the "Sort Downloads" button and watch the files shuffle into place!
5. Once it's done, a little message will pop up to let you know everything's been sorted out nice and neat.

## Requirements

- You'll need Python 3.x installed on your computer. It usually comes pre-installed, so you should be good.
- Also, make sure you have the tkinter library installed. Most systems come with it by default.
- Lastly, you'll need the shutil library, but that usually comes bundled with Python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open up your terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you saved the files.
3. Run the `fiort_software.py` script.
4. Follow the simple instructions I mentioned earlier, and you'll be up and running in no time!

## Things to Note

- Ensure you have permission to move files within the folder you select.
- Remember, this script only works its magic on the files within the chosen folder. It won't touch anything in subfolders.
- Feel free to explore the code and tweak it to better suit your needs. After all, it's all about making your life easier, right?
